# Inventory_Mobile_App

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this project is to provide users and administrators with a reliable way to visualize global inventory. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete inventory items via the mobile application and its adjacent database

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

the two types of users  that will need to interact with the application are the administrators(managers) and standard users(employees). Another potential user would be some type of IT administrator that would be able to update UI elements and implement, and monitor certain security measures.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

My overall approach to coding this app was to first focus on the backend buisness logic. Focussing on implementing database infrastructure, client side rendering and activity management. Next I like to focus on Implementing skeloton UI elements and interfaces to interact with the backend and finishing a rough prototype. After the prototype successfully passes basic test I then polish the UI and write documentation to give the baseline a good starting point and move forward from there.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Making sure the code was function started with running test durring developement, frequently building the project, and using mobile device emulators like android studio kits. Overtime a decent testable prototype was created which i then put through rigorous test.

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The hardest part of developing this application was developing a SQLite database to interact with the androidx RecyclerView Layout module. Learning how to create the adapter via the layout inflater was also very interesting but overall became a pretty good prototype implementation.

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Creating the Item Adapter module and SQLite manager object to interact both in  main activity context as public static variables in the I think demonstrates a pretty good understanding of OOP architecture principles in mobile application developement.
